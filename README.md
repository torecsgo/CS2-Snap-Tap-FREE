# Snap-Tap Simulation Software

## Overview

This software simulates the Snap-Tap technology developed by RAZER, using Python and the `pynput` library. Snap-Tap technology is designed to enhance keyboard responsiveness and accuracy by managing simultaneous key presses. This script specifically simulates this technology for the 'a' and 'd' keys, which are commonly used for movement in games like Counter-Strike 2 (CS2).

## Features

- Simulates Snap-Tap technology for the 'a' and 'd' keys.
- Manages simultaneous key presses to ensure only one key is actively pressed at a time.
- Provides console output indicating when keys are pressed or released.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library
